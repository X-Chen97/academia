Welcome to my website! I am a [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) PhD student from [Hacking Materials](https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/) research group at [Lawrence Berkeley Lab](https://www.lbl.gov/). I am so excited about applying computational methods to Materials Science. My research topics cover deep learning, computer vision, data mining, DFT simulation, etc., ranging from **something big!** (photovoltaic system with millions🤯 of solar cells) to **something small!** (atomic diffusion in angstrom-scale space😉). Check out more about my research at Publications and Presentations!

I also like cooking🍲, swimming🏊‍♂️, tennis🎾, badminton🏸 and Switch 🎮 ([Zelda](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/) is the BEST!!)
